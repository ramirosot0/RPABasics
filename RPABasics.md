What is it RPA?
- Robotoc Process Automation
- It allows anyone to define a set of instructions for a robot, also known as bots, to perform. i.e. Onboarding employees via ADP
- It is used by businesses to automate repetitive manual tasks
- It is rule based
- Must be repeated at regular intervals. As well as have defined inputs and outputs.
- It is used by businesses to automate a proccess

What is its life cycle?

RPA Lifecycle does not have a particular defined structure. The lifecycle includes different phases of the automation process.

Stages:

Discovery Phase

The initial phase of the RPA lifecycle is the discovery phase. In this phase, the developer analyzes the requirements of the client. From there it's decided whether the process can be automated or not.

Solution Design Phase

Based on the requirements, the steps to automate the task/process are designed.

A Process Definition Document is developed as well which will include the information about the overall process.

The methodology is followed in order to develop a strategy to automate tasks to reduce manual work. Once the requirements are matched, the budget is decided. Following that, a flowchart is created to understand the flow of processes. This helps in selecting which processes are right for automation. The RPA tool is used to begin the development of bots and automate tasks.

Development Phase

The developer creates scripts (bots) to automate tasks with the assistance of the RPA tools. Automation scripts and bots are created by following the PPD. There is no requirement for coding, however it can change based on the tasks that are to be automated.

User Acceptance Test (UAT)

The RPA development team tests the developed bots. The bots are tested in a pre-production environment to examine how the users can use them to automate specific tasks. If testing fails, it's transferred back to development. If successful, it moves to the next stage.

Deployment and Maintenance Phase

Bots are deployed into the production environment when only they complete the development and testing phases. After deployment, users can use them to automate their tasks. If any issues witht the bots are detected, they will go to the development and maintenance phase.

Execute Bots

This phase is where the execution of the bots take place following deployment. Bots are checked to ensure the implementation is performed based on the client's requirements.
